## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Strava

    Tracks my runs and progress
    Can share my runs with my friends

Stronger

    Tracks my lifts and tells me how much stronger I've gotten
    Has cool graphs for my lifts

Call of Duty Mobile

    Really fun game to play with friends in real time
    Its a first person shooter with multiplayer

Adobe Lightroom

    Cool to edit photos and make them appear more aesthetic
    Easy to export

Procreate

    Cheaper alternative to adobe software with lots of good tools
    Cool tools to alter images and colors - useful for physical art

IDEA:
 An idea I have for my app is for hybrid athletes. I myself consider mnyself as someone who likes to run and lift. I like the idea of being able to track both sessions on the 
 same platform. I have taken a lot of inspiration from two apps I have mentioned above. Something I'd like to do is make use of APIs for gps tracking and maybe AI (the AI is something
 I would like to figure out later. One of my biggest motivations for this platoform is getting over the paywall that exits on the previously mentioned apps while also centralizing 
 important inforamtion for athletes. I have other other ideas that I would also like to implememnt in order to allow schools and teams to use the app.


## Notes

One major challenge was getting used to the XCode UI which took a little effort to find the required tools to finish the project.
